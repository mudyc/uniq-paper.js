    <h1>uniq-paper.js</h1>

    <p>
      Unique papers is small javascript library ported from Fenfire.
      The work is based on Tuomas Lukka's and Janne Kujala's work on
      unique papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always found unique papers to be very fascinating. The
      idea of this project is to make them more easy to use. In the
      old days, say in 2003, special hardware was needed to produce
      papers but now common hardware and most browsers can run opengl
      accelerated stuff. It is time to implement unique papers with
      javascript and WebGL. I want to share the joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently implemented is one layer, originally three, one shader
      type, originally three; also missing are texture coordinate
      sizing/rotation (aka TexGenXYRepeatUnit) but there are
      additional bugs. If the paper is black - just reload the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Textures size is 5MB. I could get it down by removing alpha
      values (not used by shaders) and finetuning the precision of
      floats.
    </p>
